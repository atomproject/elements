## Some usability considerations
* Should a radio button be selected by default? [Article](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/radio-buttons-default-selection/)
* What's a good upper limit on number of radio list items?
* Are horizontal or inline radio lists used any more? (or have all been replaced with pill buttons)
