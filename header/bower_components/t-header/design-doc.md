## Simple Header
In its simplest form it just contains the name of the page the user is on, and a back button. But, other variations may be considered, such as: 
- Instead of the name of the page, a template can be applied. e.g. for a flight details page the title of the page may inclide the complete search criteria like 'origin', 'destination', 'travel date', 'number of passengers', etc.
- In certain cases, the right side of the app header may be used for displaying additional functionality like 'search' or 'toggle between list and map view'

## Complex Header
- If the app has additional functionality like switching between different modules, or user specific actions like login, profile etc. then a complex header may be placed on top of a simple header in an application, and is present on all screens.
