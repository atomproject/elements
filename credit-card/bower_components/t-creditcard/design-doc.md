Consider the following when designing Credit Card Forms
- Indicating to the user which all cards are accepted
- Is the amount to be paid a part of the form or not? If it is part of the form, can it be prefilled? Should it be shown in a read-only format with an option to edit it, so that the total number of fields is reduced?
- What should be the label for 'Name on card'? What is being asked here - the cardholders name, or whatever is written on the card? Some cards may have text like 'Instant Credit Card' printed instead of the cardholders name. 
- What kind of input masking should be used for the card number field? Should hyphens or forward slashes be part of the field? What happens if a user tries to enter anything other than a number in this field, like a space? A midline ellipsis should not be used to hide the credit card number as it obstructs smooth completion of the form when the users try to verify the number they have entered.
- Indicating the card type being used - Should the indications of allowed card types be removed or greyed out after the user starts typing in the card number?	
- Using dropdowns vs. input fields for the expiry date.
- What kind of additional security messaging could be displayed to reassure users about security of the transaction?
- Is it possible to remove the name field from the form?
- Strike a balance between providing a helpful error message and maintaining security. You could cause vulnerability with a message such as ‘CVV mismatch’, so avoid being too specific.
- If appropriate, provide an option to scan the card.
