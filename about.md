# About

This is a collection of custom elements by the atom project. 

This site enables you to explore these elements. You can change their properties from the panel on the right, see the code for each element below it. You can also see how the element would look or behave on mobile devices. Developer documentation and design documentation for every element is available, though some are a work in progress.

The ability to style these elements centrally using an interface is being worked upon & is coming soon.

Further documentation for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/atomproject/docs).

To use this element browser interface for your elements, please see the setup guide.
