## Web Components

Web Components are a set of standards that allow for the creation of custom HTML elements. With this, people can easily create elements which 
* encapsulate functionality & style 
* aid reusabiliy
* provide semantic structure to their code
* can update automatically across pages
* and run wherever HTML does - with any framework, language or platform of choice

Developers are thus able to create unique building blocks suited to their needs and extend the vocabulary of the web.

Both UI and Non-UI (API only) elements can be created. These elements can not only be shared across a single web application but can also be distributed on the web for use by others.

## Atom Elements

This is a collection of custom elements by the atom project. 

This site enables you to explore these elements. When viewing elements, you can change their properties from the panel on the right, see the code for each element below it. You can also see how the element would look or behave on mobile devices. Developer documentation and design documentation for every element is available, though some are a work in progress.

The ability to style these elements centrally using an interface is being worked upon & is coming soon.

Further documentation for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/atomproject/docs).

To use this element browser interface for your elements, please see the setup guide.
