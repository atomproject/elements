# Designing Full Page Loaders

- The first thing to consider is when to use a full page loader. Its overuse should be avoided and it is best used not more than once in an app.
- The context that best suits its use is after the user has completed filling a search form related to the primary commodity offered by an app - like flights, vacations, books
- The next thing to consider is the content to be displayed in the interstitial loader. Typically, showing the search criteria along with a progress bar and some branding element like a logo is done.
- The interstitial loader can be a good place to have some animated elements. Animations can be realted to the domain of the app e.g. flights or flying for a travel app, or the logo
