Tabs are the simplest of the container elements. The minimum number of tabs possible is 2. Currently no maximum number is defined, but ideally some upper limit should be defined. When the space needed by tabs exceeds the available width (usually on mobile devices), icons appear on either side of the tabs to allow scrolling. An alternate to scrolling could be to show an icon for more items, clicking which could display a list of the remaining tabs — however this is currently not implemented & is under consideration.
