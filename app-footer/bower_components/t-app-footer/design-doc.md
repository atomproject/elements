The first thing to consider is whether the footer is for a web app or native app. Native apps usually dont have footers as that information is presented elsewhere in the app.

There is a wide variety in footers from a simple copyright to super footers containing groups of links.

So an important thing to consider would be what all information is necessary to display. Commonly this may include
- A copyright notice
- Contact info like phone number and email address
- Logo
- Groups of links related to various aspects of the product or site
