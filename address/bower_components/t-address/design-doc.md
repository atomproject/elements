- Consider variations in terminology by country. In non-US countries, city, state, zip code may be called other things like prefecture, department, territory, province, township, ward, and postal code.
- Some addresses require that you need a name for a company, like when you need a c/o
- Having the state as 2 letters to be typed or chosen from a dropdown. A third option may be a combination of both these approaches.
- Address line 1 and line 2 can have a large number of characters, much more than 100, so setting limits may be problematic
- Possibly using the zip code to populate city and state. Zip codes may not be globally unique, so this may be done once the country is known
- Using an autocomplete for the city name may help if the dropdown has too many options
- Using a generic structure for international addresses vs. changing the structure based on country selected.
- Military addresses are structured differently from regular addresses.
